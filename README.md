### About Me

I'm a computer science major at [Saint Francis University][1].

I recently joined GitHub, and I'm working on uploading some of my projects.

My New Year's resolution is to explore and grow into new programming languages.

I've written several plugins for the Vim text editor.
You can survey my full suite of Vim plugins [here](full-suite.vimrc).
